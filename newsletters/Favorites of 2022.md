It's come to the time where I post about my favorite things from the previous year. 

#### First I wanna talk about shows.

![Top shows of 2022](https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/40b6882a201ac16ee5b647c5501134746f69fb21/images/644f168a-4107-038d-e7c7-cabbb8a680d1.jpg)

1.  Atlanta(FX) - This show had two seasons air in 2022, both were some of the most phenomenal episodes that sat in my brain the rest of the year. These final seasons were excellent and I'm excited to see what these creators make next.
2.  Andor(Disney+) - I'm someone who has watched all the latest live-action star wars show, but not liked any of them. Why do I do this to myself? No idea, but the entire time I  was hoping I would stumble across something like Andor. The Star Wars universe doesn't deserve such a great show.
3.  Better Call Saul(AMC) - Another final season of a TV show, Better Call Saul is a prequel-ish show to the hit TV show Breaking Bad. This show had some powerful moments that were a great closure to a great show.
4.  Severance(Apple TV+) - Rarely do I binge a show. Even if I love a show, and all the episodes are out, I'm usually one who just slowly enjoys something. This was the exception to that. Once I started watching this I couldn't stop, and then I got my wife to watch it and rewatched a lot of it with her. 
5.  Peacemaker(HBO Max) - Look up the opening credits on youtube and if after watching that you're intrigued then this show might be for you. 
6.  Welcome to Wexham(FX) - I'm not the hugest fan of either Ryan Reynolds or Rob McElhenney so I was very suspect of this show, but I love football and stories of small clubs. What a wonderful tale of a small town.
7.  Station Eleven(HBO Max) - I liked, didn't love, this book and was hesitant to watch something about the aftermath of a virus that wipes out almost all of humanity. I was also a little unsure how this book might be adapted as a show,  because it's very stream of consciousness writing, but I was pleasantly surprised at the results.
8.  The Sandman(Netflix) - Another show based on a book, this one from my youth. A beloved graphic novel that was another that I had fears about how they were going to turn it into something for a streaming service. 
9.  The Rehearsal(HBO Max) - This show is very difficult to describe. If you're familiar with Nathen Felders other works you might have an idea of what you'd be getting in to. I can't say I totally enjoyed(or agreed with the premise set forth) everything here, but nothing else this year caused so much conversations.
10.  Pachinko(Apple TV+) - This show is beautiful and moving. A runner up for best opening of any TV this year.
11.  Strange New Worlds(Paramount+) - I'm on record for enjoying all almost all the new Star Trek shows(I'm looking at you Picard) and this one is no different. Enjoyable space adventures.

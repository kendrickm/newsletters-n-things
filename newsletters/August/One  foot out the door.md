- August 7th
I'm embarking on a project for the remaining weeks of the year to try and write one of these every  week. Short and just to stretch the writing muscles, make me listen to the earth a little more.

#### Something I learned
In the last week I spent a lot of time working on getting back in to the swing of things. One thing I found was re-igniting my love of baking. The first half of the year had taken its toll on me; I'm just now starting to get back in the groove of enjoying it again.

#### What I'm reading
_The  Big Four_ by Agatha Christie. I'm late(obviously) to the Poirot mysteries but I'm starting to really get in to them. This one introduced a fun "supervillain" that Poirot spends a lot of time tracking down(and getting tracked down by)

#### What I'm watching
_The Talented Mr Ripley_ For some reason I had thought this movie was going to be a super smart con artist impersonating people and taking advantages of his situation. And that's part of this story, but also is a tale of someone who desperately wants to rise about their station and it brings out some fascinating character drama. Even with its 2hr+ runtime I was still left questioning some motives of Ripley. How much was an act and how much was his truth?

- August 24
I went camping for the first time in a while. Being in nature was nice, but when I got home I found my dishwasher had started leaking! Now I'm trying to figure out if I need to fix it or  replace it ðŸ˜©

#### Something I learned
The importance of maintaining flexibility - My back had started bothering me,  and so I've been returning to doing  some yoga and  core  exercises. Wow I'm out of shape! Felt good to get back in that habit though and I'm hoping to maintain, and increase it, to hopefully prevent any further issues.

#### What I'm reading
[The Mountain in the Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59808603-the-mountain-in-the-sea) by Ray Nayler - Really interesting  near-future sci-fi about the meaning of language, and what it means to communicate with others.

#### What I'm watching
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds - Wow I'm  in love with the new slate  of star trek shows. This second season had some  of my favorite star trek episodes - EVER.

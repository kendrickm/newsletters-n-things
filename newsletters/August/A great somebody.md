_My life is destined to be filled with positivity._ - Adrienne Sealy Hardesty

Had a lot of  great social interactions last week and I finally saw Barbie!

#### Something I learned
I always scoffed, laughed, poked fun at, razzed - you name it - when it came to geeking out about organizational things. Entire stores are dedicated to the art of  storing your stuff, and this seemed very bizarre to me. Well let me tell you, I have been on a journey of organizing and remodeling my workshop and one of the major steps in doing this has been FINDING ORGANIZATION TIPS I'm talking boxes, crates, totes, bins, things on wheels, hooks, pegboards, labels ALL OF IT I'm here for it. Theres so many useful ways to store things and have a functioning, and organized workspace. 

#### What I'm reading
_Gideon the Ninth_ - This is an interesting gothic/futuristic/sci-fi? book that presented a lot of interesting settings and visuals. I had a few issues with the way people talk(it felt weirdly present-day for a world that was entirely not like present-day) but the atmosphere was very enjoyable.

#### What I'm watching
_X Files: Season 2_ - Watching this for a TV club I'm in. Most episodes don't hold up but theres a few gems in there.

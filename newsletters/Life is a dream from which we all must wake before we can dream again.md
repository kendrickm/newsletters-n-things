I've fallen off being consistent with these newsletters, but at least once a month isn't terrible.  I'm trying  to  reflect on what happens  each week, and that is enough of a challenge.

#### Something I learned
Verify where you're going - I got both my covid and flu vaccines this week. The trouble was I did not verify the pharmacy  I was  headed to. So I was  headed to the wrong one, had to reverse course, rush and show up late so I was stuck waiting in line. Not the worst but good reminder to make sure you know where you're going.

#### What I'm reading
[Drinking French](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51847693-drinking-french) - I've long been in love with French cuisine, culture, and language. Lately I've been picking up several books by acclaimed cookbook author David Lebovitz. This is a great history and  collection  of cocktails, syrups, mixtures, and other  beverages. 

#### What I'm watching
[The Diplomat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diplomat_(American_TV_series)) -  Working  through some shows from earlier this year that got a lot of buzz, and I'm finally starting this. Wow it's amazing.  A great political thriller that really captivates. I'm a huge fan of Keri Russell and she shines in this.

Happy September! I  did a bunch of  house projects  this week! And my garden is in full production mode so I'm constantly making apple sauce, drying plums, brewing with the hops, watering the kale; it's a full time job! Looking forward to a little slower  of a fall  season once this is all finished. 

#### Something I learned
No amount of reading the instructions can prepare you for  the real thing - I put in a new garage door this week. I read the  instructions several times, and watched the youtube videos multiple times. I was not, however, prepared for the state of my garage and dealing with the  frame note being fully square. Provided multiple hours of frustration, swearing, contemplating burning it all down, and problem solving.

#### What I'm reading
[Captain Vorpatril's Alliance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12998057-captain-vorpatril-s-alliance) The penultimate full-length book in  the Vorkosigan series, this is classic  in the style of the series. People bumbling through sci-fi adventures finding love and excitement. 
#### What I'm watching
How To With John Wilson  -  The show is in its final season and I'm so sad to be seeing it go. It is such a bizarre collection of life's stories.
